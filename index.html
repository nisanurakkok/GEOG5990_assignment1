				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p> Hello! </p>
				<p> My student number is 2015388663 </p>
				<p> I am Nisa Akkok.  I go to the university of Leeds, currently studying Geographical information systems.
				I am a recent 2021 graduate  of Geography from Oxford Brookes University. <p>
				<p> I initally did not think making maps was want i wanted to do, i put off taking the module of GIS in my second year
				but with limited other modules left i decided to take it, as i thought it would be a good skill to have. I realised that
				making maps was want i wanted to do which qucikly led to me applying for my masters. It was a great way to 
				be passionate about the environment while being about to reasearch, create and talk about the importance of various topics.</p>
